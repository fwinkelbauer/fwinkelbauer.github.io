What a surprise. In fact,
Emacs is one of my most used tools besides other stables such as a browser. What
has changed though, is how I am using some aspects of this little editor.</p><h2 id=what-has-not-changed>What Has Not Changed</h2><p>I still believe, that Emacs is not the &ldquo;right&rdquo; tool for everything. I&rsquo;m still
jumping into Notepad++ if I want to do a very quick edit on a Windows machine.
I&rsquo;m also not thinking about moving tasks such as e-mail into Emacs.</p><h2 id=terrific-task-management>Terrific Task Management</h2><p>Org-mode is great. It has replaced all other note taking or calendar management
software that I was using. Everything (well, 90%) lives in org-mode. I have one
&ldquo;big&rdquo; (300 lines-ish) file which contains everything I&rsquo;d like to remember or
would like to do.</p><h2 id=underwhelming-windows-performance>Underwhelming Windows Performance</h2><p>My Windows machines run a native version of Emacs, which is&mldr; just ok. Some
actions take a few seconds, which just feels sluggish, but that&rsquo;s something that
I have to live with for now.</p><p>One of my biggest pain points was setting up spell checking on Windows. It might
sound too simple, but it took me several attempts before I pulled it off. Thanks
<a href=https://florianwinkelbauer.com/posts/2019-04-10-emacs-wsl/>WSL</a>.</p><h2 id=literate-dotfiles>Literate Dotfiles</h2><p>Most of my config files and custom scripts live in an org file inside a git
repository. Using a simple shortcut, I can create &ldquo;real&rdquo; config files based on
this org file. I have mentioned this process in a <a href=https://florianwinkelbauer.com/posts/2019-08-10-literate-dotfiles/>previous post</a>.</p><h2 id=keybindings>Keybindings</h2><p>Emacs keybindings can feel clunky and some people even feel pain after using
them for too long. Based on several resources (such as <a href=https://karl-voit.at/2018/07/08/emacs-key-bindings/>this one</a>), I have
created a whole set of custom keybindings which are based on sequences instead
of chords. Instead of pressing &ldquo;Control + x&rdquo; and &ldquo;Control + f&rdquo; (<code>C-x C-f</code>) I can
now press &ldquo;Apps&rdquo; and &ldquo;f&rdquo; to search for a file. It took me some time to get used
to some of these bindings, but I think it was worth the effort. And if I ever
end up in a situation where I have to use a keyboard without an &ldquo;Apps&rdquo; key, I
can still fallback to the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; keybindings.</p><h2 id=strong-stables>Strong Stables</h2><p>I&rsquo;d like to make a quick shout out to some fantastic packages which I use
everyday:</p><ul><li>elfeed (my RSS reader)</li><li>ivy, counsel, swiper (improved search and navigation)</li><li>magit (hands down, the best git client I have ever used)</li><li>neotree (a tree based file viewer)</li></ul><h2 id=the-journey-continues>The Journey Continues</h2><p>Even though the learning curve started out steep, I&rsquo;m glad that I picked up
Emacs. For now, I don&rsquo;t have any specific goals on how this journey should
continue. Instead, I&rsquo;ll just have to see where things take me.</p></article></main><footer><p>Copyright 2023, Florian Winkelbauer. All rights reserved.</p></footer></body></html>
