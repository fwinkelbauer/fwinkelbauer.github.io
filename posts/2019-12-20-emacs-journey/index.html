<h1 class="title">My Emacs Journey 2019</h1>
</header><p>
Let me start my saying that yes, I still use Emacs. What a surprise. In fact,
Emacs is one of my most used tools besides other stables such as a browser. What
has changed though, is how I am using some aspects of this little editor.

<p>
I still believe, that Emacs is not the "right" tool for everything. I'm still
jumping into Notepad++ if I want to do a very quick edit on a Windows machine.
I'm also not thinking about moving tasks such as e-mail into Emacs.

<p>
Org-mode is great. It has replaced all other note taking or calendar management
software that I was using. Everything (well, 90%) lives in org-mode. I have one
"big" (300 lines-ish) file which contains everything I'd like to remember or
would like to do.

<h2 id="orgf06f210">Underwhelming Windows Performance</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf06f210">
<p>
My Windows machines run a native version of Emacs, which is&#x2026; just ok. Some
actions take a few seconds, which just feels sluggish, but that's something that
I have to live with for now.

One of my biggest pain points was setting up spell checking on Windows. It might
sound too simple, but it took me several attempts before I pulled it off. Thanks

<h2 id="orga44fa55">Literate Dotfiles</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga44fa55">
<p>
Most of my config files and custom scripts live in an org file inside a git
repository. Using a simple shortcut, I can create "real" config files based on
this org file. I have mentioned this process in a <a href="/posts/2019-08-10-literate-dotfiles">previous post</a>.

<h2 id="org8c0cc2b">Keybindings</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org8c0cc2b">
<p>
Emacs keybindings can feel clunky and some people even feel pain after using
them for too long. Based on several resources (such as <a href="https://karl-voit.at/2018/07/08/emacs-key-bindings/">this one</a>), I have created
a whole set of custom keybindings which are based on sequences instead of
chords. Instead of pressing "Control + x" and "Control + f" (<code>C-x C-f</code>) I can
now press "Apps" and "f" to search for a file. It took me some time to get used
to some of these bindings, but I think it was worth the effort. And if I ever
end up in a situation where I have to use a keyboard without an "Apps" key, I
can still fallback to the "normal" keybindings.

I'd like to make a quick shout out to some fantastic packages which I use
everyday:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>elfeed (my RSS reader)</li>
<li>ivy, counsel, swiper (improved search and navigation)</li>
<li>magit (hands down, the best git client I have ever used)</li>
<li>neotree (a tree based file viewer)</li>

<p>
Even though the learning curve started out steep, I'm glad that I picked up
Emacs. For now, I don't have any specific goals on how this journey should
continue. Instead, I'll just have to see where things take me.
