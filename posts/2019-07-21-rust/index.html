while on vacation. While I&rsquo;ve heard that programming in Rust is pretty much a
fight with the borrow checker, I haven&rsquo;t had a clear idea what this could
<strong>really</strong> mean. Well, now I know. The borrow checker is friend and foe at the
same time. I&rsquo;m still far away from grasping all concepts mentioned in the book,
but I was able to produce my very first (useful!) program. It&rsquo;s a rewrite of a
Python script which transforms CSV exports from my bank account into a CSV
format which I can import in <a href=http://homebank.free.fr>Homebank</a>. It&rsquo;s interesting to see a
language, which forces you to be very explicit about your error handling. My
first job made me switch from Java, which forces you to declare every (well,
let&rsquo;s say most) possible Exception in a method, to C#, a language which does not
care about any explicit exception declarations. One could argue which approach
is &ldquo;better&rdquo;, but Rust takes error handling on a whole different level, which is
interesting, hard and insightful. It makes me aware of problems, which I&rsquo;ve
ignored in other languages. I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;ll keep trying to write hobby
projects in Rust, but it sure was a breath of fresh air.</p></article></main><footer><p>Copyright 2023, Florian Winkelbauer. All rights reserved.</p></footer></body></html>
