I've recently finished reading the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/">The Rust Programming Language Book</a> while on
vacation. While I've heard that programming in Rust is pretty much a fight with
the borrow checker, I haven't had a clear idea what this could <b>really</b> mean.
Well, now I know. The borrow checker is friend and foe at the same time. I'm
still far away from grasping all concepts mentioned in the book, but I was able
to produce my very first (useful!) program. It's a rewrite of a Python script
which transforms CSV exports from my bank account into a CSV format which I can
import in <a href="http://homebank.free.fr">Homebank</a>. It's interesting to see a language, which forces you to be
very explicit about your error handling. My first job made me switch from Java,
which forces you to declare every (well, let's say most) possible Exception in a
method, to C#, a language which does not care about any explicit exception
declarations. One could argue which approach is "better", but Rust takes error
handling on a whole different level, which is interesting, hard and insightful.
It makes me aware of problems, which I've ignored in other languages. I'm not
sure if I'll keep trying to write hobby projects in Rust, but it sure was a
breath of fresh air.
