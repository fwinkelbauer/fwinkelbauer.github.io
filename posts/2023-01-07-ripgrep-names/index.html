The other day I was wondering if I could use <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">ripgrep</a> to do a combined search of
file names and their content. While this feature does not come out of the box,
it turns out that one can implement it in a straightforward way. Ripgrep comes
with a <code>--files</code> flag which lists all files that a search operation would
consider (Remember: ripgrep can decide to skip files based on some criteria,
e.g. if a file is listed in a <code>.gitignore</code> file). Since the output of <code>--files</code>
is text based, we can use a pipe to also search through those lines as well. A
bash script could look like this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">rg --files | rg "$1"
rg "$1"
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Other command line tools such as <code>find</code> or <a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/fd">fd</a> might be better suited to search
for file names, but the above approach has a convenience aspect, since we can
use the same search expression for two different searches. Thanks Andrew for
coming up with such an awesome tool!
