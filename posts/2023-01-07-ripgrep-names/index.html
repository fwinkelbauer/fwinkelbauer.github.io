search of file names and their content. While this feature does not come out of
the box, it turns out that one can implement it in a straightforward way.
Ripgrep comes with a <code>--files</code> flag which lists all files that a search
operation would consider (Remember: ripgrep can decide to skip files based on
some criteria, e.g. if a file is listed in a <code>.gitignore</code> file). Since the
output of <code>--files</code> is text based, we can use a pipe to also search through
those lines as well. A bash script could look like this:</p><pre><code class=language-shell>rg --files | rg &quot;$1&quot;
rg &quot;$1&quot;
</code></pre><p>Other command line tools such as <code>find</code> or <a href=https://github.com/sharkdp/fd>fd</a> might be better suited to
search for file names, but the above approach has a convenience aspect, since we
can use the same search expression for two different searches. Thanks Andrew for
coming up with such an awesome tool!</p></article></main><footer><p>Copyright 2023, Florian Winkelbauer. All rights reserved.</p></footer></body></html>
