"Fun Monday Links" was a work related fun project in which I tried to lighten up
the start of the work week by talking about an interesting link in a humorous
way. You can find all entries (slightly edited) below:

Welcome to "Fun Monday Links" (FML)! A weekly post about rad tech stuff. Our
first edition is about our favorite topic: version control!
</p>

<p>
Who wouldn't want to tell their non-technical friends how cool git is, right?
Well, good news! <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1349230/5D_Chess_With_Multiverse_Time_Travel/">5D Chess With Multiverse Time Travel</a> is the perfect game to
explain git. Be the star at any party while explaining concepts such as non-fast
forward merges, cherry-picks, rebases or more advanced commands like git rerere.
</p>

<p>
And for the people who crave more, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M75aENmuzmo">here</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtUCZYyv-_w">here</a> are two videos about more fancy
git features.
</p>

<p>
My personal favorites include:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>git clean</code> to delete files that are not in version control</li>
<li><code>git rev-parse --show-toplevel</code> gives you the current directory which houses
your git repo. Very useful for scripting!</li>
<li><code>git ls-files</code> to search files in your git index</li>
<li><code>git grep</code> works the same as a normal grep but is limited to the index</li>
<li><code>git reflog</code> for when I screwed up and I need a hero that I don't deserve</li>
</ul>

It's Monday! Welcome to FML Episode #2.

<p>
We all know that computers are fast, right? But how fast are they really? Humans
have no good intuition on the difference between nano- and microseconds. The
following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDBOC6I3K8g">video link</a> (8 minutes) puts things into perspective using a 1 Hertz
CPU.
</p>

<p>
Here's the gist. This is a list of access times of a 3ghz CPU:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Register: 0.3ns</li>
<li>L1 cache: 1.5ns</li>
<li>L2 cache: 3ns</li>
<li>L3 cache 13ns</li>
<li>RAM: 0.1 microseconds</li>
<li>HDD: 6ms</li>
<li>SSD: 80 microseconds</li>
</ul>

<p>
All these values seem "low enough", but let's compare them using a 1 Hertz CPU:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Register: 1 second</li>
<li>L1 cache: 4.5 seconds</li>
<li>L2 cache: 9 seconds</li>
<li>L3 cache: 39 seconds</li>
<li>RAM: 5 minutes</li>
<li>HDD: 9 months</li>
<li>SSD: 1 day</li>
</ul>

<p>
The next time you say to yourself "oh cool XYZ only took a couple of minutes",
think about how many centuries have past for a computer. It's insane.

This week is about performance as well. And some history: LMAX probably built
the first open source financial exchange, a high performance, low latency system
built for trading. You might think that the overall architecture is very
complicated and that it was written in a systems language such as C++, but no.
LMAX and the underlying main data structure (known as The Disruptor - yes,
that's the official name) are built using Java.
</p>

<p>
Martin Fowler has written <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/lmax.html">a long article</a> about the project.
</p>

<p>
The Disruptor has influenced a bunch of other technologies, such as a new
database called Tigerbeetle and it even found its way into the Linux kernel:
iouring was inspired by LMAX as well.
</p>

<p>
Martin Thompson, one of the initial people who worked on LMAX/The Disruptor, is
now developing a high performance, low latency messaging queue called <a href="https://aeron.io/">Aeron</a>. In
Java. Obviously.

In the old times backup tools differentiated between "full" and "incremental"
backups in order to safe space. Nowadays newer tools such as restic or borg use
deduplication techniques to unify these backups into a single
directory/repository. In a way every backup is now full and incremental at the
same time.
</p>

<p>
Restic in particular uses (among other things) a technique called content
defined chunking to split files into pieces. The cool thing about this technique
is that it can also be applied in cases where you want to ship data updates to
people.
</p>

<p>
This <a href="https://technology.riotgames.com/news/supercharging-data-delivery-new-league-patcher">blog post</a> describes how Riot Games (the company behind a game called League
Of Legends) uses content defined chunking to ship updates to players/users.

Conway's Law states, that a software architecture mirrors the structure of an
organization. In other words: If you have two development teams you end up with
a software that consists of at least two components.
</p>

<p>
In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUj1EZwpJY">this video</a> Casey claims that Conway's Law is too optimistic. In his mind a
software architecture mirrors all organizational structures that a company has
and has had. That means that you will find abandoned code lingering in your code
base of previous employees. He gives a concrete example using Windows 10, where
you can find the same GUI to control volume settings implemented in 3-4
different ways.
</p>

<p>
If we consider a sociotechnical system where we humans are part of the software
system, we are in a way responsible to grow but also to trim software since it
can't do that on its own. So "dealing with technical debt" is more or less
ensuring that we kill and recreate something so that components do not grow
uncontrollable. Cell growth and an immune system do basically the same thing.
And we know what happens in a biological body if stuff (cells) refuse to die,
right?

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pTEmbeENF4">This</a> is a presentation from Bret Victor in 2013. The fun bit is that he pretends
to be presenting in the year 1973 (using overhead slides, of course). He talks
about recent developments in computers and programming (remember, it's 1973) and
explains how some cool ideas and concepts will shape the next 30-40 years. I
could say "no spoilers" but we pretty much know "the future"&#x2026;

I got a treat for you if your new year resolutions include "building something
very nerdy": <a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/">Crafting Interpreters</a> is a book about building your own programming
language. It's a great read and the online version is free ! Last year the book
inspired me to write my own command line parser. It's a much more narrow, but
also interesting challenge.

We all know that software has bugs. We sometimes forget that file systems are
software too. Have fun watching Dan Luu talk about the horrors that lurk

Last week we talked about how spooky file systems are. Good think that we can
still rely on our trusty old friend the database, right? &#x2026; right?
</p>

<p>
Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZjhNTM8XU8">Martin Kleppmann</a> talk about ACID and how that term is more or less just
marketing slang without any real meaning. My favorite bits from this talk: Hope
that your red cross organization does not use Oracle Do you know the default
isolation level of your database and what kind of read or write race conditions
that can cause? Very spooky!
</p>

<p>
Martin is also the author of <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/">Designing Data-Intensive Applications</a>. A terrific
book!

Last week we told our self horror stories about transaction. Let's go a level
deeper and talk about how buffered IO and fsync are fundamentally broken. Check
out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC1B3d9C_sI">this presentation</a> about Tiger Beetle, a database that deals with financial
transactions that was built from scratch. The coolest bit is the demo in the
second half of the video where they simulate several instances of Tiger Beetle
communicating with each other in a freaking game engine. As the "player" you can
simulate events such as network partitions or an instance becoming offline. Much
cool. Very techy. Wow.

The holy war between programming paradigms has been going on for all eternity.
What's better? Functional or object oriented programming? If you are curious,
Rafal Dittwald gives a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK1DazRK_a0">great example</a> of how the thinking between those two are
different. Both paradigms agree that state is the root of all evil. But
computers would just be expensive heating machines if we would just ignore
state.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>OOP: state is hard. So let's split it and hide it as much as possible</li>
<li>FP: state is hard. Minimize it or move all of this confusing stuff into one
place</li>
</ul>

<p>
The video contains an example code in Java with cool color coding to highlight
statements which are having evil side effects/state manipulation. Rafal then
goes on to refactor the code into a more functional style while keeping the
color coding.

We know that computers are complicated, but scanners should be simple, shouldn't

I'm happily married to a lovely wife, but as a grown man I still have my overly
manly crushes on other man. One of them is Rich Hickey.
</p>

<p>
Rich used to be a C++/Java developer until the day he got fed up with writing
the same programs over and over. He took a sabbatical (burning through his own
money) to build a new programming language based on the JVM. Today we know this
language as Clojure. Clojure became popular in some circles and Rich ended up
with his own consulting company which was bought by a bank a few years ago.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="https://github.com/tallesl/Rich-Hickey-fanclub">Rich Hickey Fanclub</a> has the cool subtext "every time I watch one of his
talks I feel like someone has gone in and organized my brain" which I find to be
true. His insights about programming are interesting and I love to watch his
talks. It takes some time to get used to all the Clojure related stuff, but the
general ideas he has are often interesting.
