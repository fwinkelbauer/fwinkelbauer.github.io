</header><p>
It has been two years since I have started to work on my hobby project
<a href="https://github.com/fwinkelbauer/chunkyard">Chunkyard</a>. Over these years I have used this project to test out different ideas
and concepts, which is something that you cannot always do in a professional
environment. This post highlights a few topics which I have explored.

<h2 id="orgc497d81">Ambitions</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc497d81">
<p>
My initial plans were to create some sort of general purpose library (hah!) that
I could use to implement different types of applications such as a version
control system, a backup tool or some sort of application installer/updater. But
reality is messy and so I had to abandon those plans rather quickly. Creating a
content-addressable storage with or without encryption comes with its own set of
pitfalls, which makes it hard to come up with a general solution. So instead of
a library I settled for the application that I wanted to build.

A backup tool must be reliable. You don't want to end up in a situation where a
bug breaks your data. All my backups are done using Chunkyard, so preventing
mistakes is something that is important to me in more than one way. While I
cannot ensure that the code base is free of bugs, I have come up with a testing
suite that gives me enough confidence to explore ideas or implement features.

<h2 id="orgc73493f">Design</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc73493f">
<p>
Since I do not have any "real" users (besides myself), I can test out all sorts
of designs without having to consider backwards compatibility. Re-reading older
posts such as <a href="/posts/2020-10-03-chunkyard-explained">Chunkyard Explained</a> makes me laugh, because the serialized data
format has changed more than once since I have written that post.
</p>

Chunkyard was the first project in which I have developed a makefile-style build
tool in C#. Some of my work colleagues liked the idea and we ported the concept
to one our own projects.

<h2 id="org43fb3cb">Performance</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org43fb3cb">
<p>
I have no deep understanding of how a computer actually works. Don't get me
wrong, Chunkyard is not slow, but listening to people such as Martin Thompson
makes you wonder how much resources you are wasting for non-essential work. His
conference talks motivated me to write a lock-free ring buffer which is still an
experimental feature for creating backups. Measuring is not always easy since
antivirus software, the actual hardware and some OS-internal caching magic makes
it hard to get meaningful data.
