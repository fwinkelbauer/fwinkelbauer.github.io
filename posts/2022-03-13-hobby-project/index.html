<a href=https://github.com/fwinkelbauer/chunkyard>Chunkyard</a>. Over these years I have used this project to test out
different ideas and concepts, which is something that you cannot always do in a
professional environment. This post highlights a few topics which I have
explored.</p><h2 id=ambitions>Ambitions</h2><p>My initial plans were to create some sort of general purpose library (hah!) that
I could use to implement different types of applications such as a version
control system, a backup tool or some sort of application installer/updater. But
reality is messy and so I had to abandon those plans rather quickly. Creating a
content-addressable storage with or without encryption comes with its own set of
pitfalls, which makes it hard to come up with a general solution. So instead of
a library I settled for the application that I wanted to build.</p><h2 id=tests>Tests</h2><p>A backup tool must be reliable. You don&rsquo;t want to end up in a situation where a
bug breaks your data. All my backups are done using Chunkyard, so preventing
mistakes is something that is important to me in more than one way. While I
cannot ensure that the code base is free of bugs, I have come up with a testing
suite that gives me enough confidence to explore ideas or implement features.</p><h2 id=design>Design</h2><p>Since I do not have any &ldquo;real&rdquo; users (besides myself), I can test out all sorts
of designs without having to consider backwards compatibility. Re-reading older
posts such as <a href=https://florianwinkelbauer.com/posts/2020-10-03-chunkyard-explained/>Chunkyard Explained</a> makes me laugh, because the
serialized data format has changed more than once since I have written that
post.</p><p>Chunkyard was the first project in which I have developed a makefile-style build
tool in C#. Some of my work colleagues liked the idea and we ported the concept
to one our own projects.</p><h2 id=performance>Performance</h2><p>I have no deep understanding of how a computer actually works. Don&rsquo;t get me
wrong, Chunkyard is not slow, but listening to people such as Martin Thompson
makes you wonder how much resources you are wasting for non-essential work. His
conference talks motivated me to write a lock-free ring buffer which is still an
experimental feature for creating backups. Measuring is not always easy since
antivirus software, the actual hardware and some OS-internal caching magic makes
it hard to get meaningful data.</p><h2 id=future-work>Future Work</h2><ul><li>Figure out how to use <a href=https://fscheck.github.io/FsCheck/>FsCheck</a></li><li>Learn to utilize a profiler to find bottlenecks</li><li>Try to replace <a href=https://github.com/commandlineparser/commandline>commandlineparser</a> with <a href=https://github.com/dotnet/command-line-api>System.CommandLine</a></li></ul></article></main><footer><p>Copyright 2023, Florian Winkelbauer.
