for some reason you just keep stumbling upon new profound things you just didn&rsquo;t
know about them. I had this moment when I discovered timers. There are different
ways to clock work or to start an increasing or decreasing timer which are
described in the org-mode documentation <a href=https://orgmode.org/manual/Clocking-Work-Time.html>here</a> and <a href=https://orgmode.org/manual/Timers.html#Timers>here</a>.
These functions can be used to interact with a decreasing timer:</p><pre><code class=language-emacs-lisp>(org-timer-set-timer)
(org-timer-pause-or-continue)
(org-timer-stop)
</code></pre><p>While these timers are convenient, I was surprised that Emacs won&rsquo;t warn me about
a running timer when closing the application. Luckily adding a timer check only
takes a few lines of code:</p><pre><code class=language-emacs-lisp>(add-to-list 'kill-emacs-query-functions
             (lambda ()
               (or (not (and (boundp 'org-timer-start-time)
                             org-timer-start-time))
                   (y-or-n-p &quot;Quit with running org-timer?&quot;))))
</code></pre><p>This little piece of code is called when closing Emacs. It will check if a timer
is still running and will ask you what to do about it.</p></article></main><footer><p>Copyright 2022, Florian Winkelbauer. All rights reserved.</p></footer></body></html>
