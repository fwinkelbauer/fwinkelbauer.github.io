custom code as much as possible to see if I can live without them. This gives me
an opportunity to find ways that work with either vanilla Emacs or with tools
that are already installed through plugin dependencies.</p><h1 id=one-transient-to-rule-them-all>One Transient To Rule Them All</h1><p>All of my custom keybindings are accessible using the <code>&lt;apps></code> or <code>&lt;menu></code> keys.
<code>&lt;f5></code> is used as a fallback for keyboards which don&rsquo;t have either of these
keys. The major change to last year is that I have switched from the hydra
package to transient, which is already installed if you are using magit. This
change reduced the overall packages I need to install while also making my
custom menus really look nice. Here&rsquo;s what the main transient looks like:</p><p><img src=/images/transient-main.png alt="transient main"></p><p>And this is an example screenshot of the project related transient which is
available by pressing <code>&lt;apps> g</code>:</p><p><img src=/images/transient-project.png alt="transient project"></p><h1 id=goodbye-ivy>Goodbye Ivy</h1><p>Ivy, counsel and swiper were some of my most used packages. They have some
quirks, but the overall feature set is just fantastic (thanks abo-abo!). Over
the last few months several people have tried to use some of the newer
completion frameworks, which made me curious. I&rsquo;m now using a combination of
vertico, orderless, counsel and embark. While the number of packages has
increased, the overall amount of code was reduced. Out of all these packages,
embark is the one with the most unused potential in my setup. I miss ivy&rsquo;s
minibuffer actions and I haven&rsquo;t grokked embark enough to re-implement them.</p><h1 id=org-publish>Org Publish</h1><p>I have tried (and failed) to rewrite this blog using <code>org-publish</code>. You can find
a dozen of tutorials on how people migrated their blog to org, but for some
reason I just can&rsquo;t get it to work the way I want. This frustration makes you
wonder if you should write your own static blog generator, but the world already
has enough of these custom generator projects.</p></article></main><footer><p>Copyright 2022, Florian Winkelbauer. All rights reserved.</p></footer></body></html>
