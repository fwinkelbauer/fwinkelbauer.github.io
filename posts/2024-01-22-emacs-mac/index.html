</header><p>
I have been using a MacBook as a development machine since I have started my new
job back in November. This was the first time that I have used MacOS for more
than a few minutes. Installing Emacs was easy using the package manager
HomeBrew, but it took me a couple of days to figure out all customization that I
need to be comfortable. So if you are a Windows/Linux user and feel lost (just
like I did), this might be useful to you:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">; Change modifier keys so that they are similar to Windows/Linux:
(setq mac-option-modifier nil
      mac-command-modifier 'meta)

; MacOS has a different version of ls compared to GNU ls. You can install "gls"
; using HomeBrew. After that you can configure dired the way you want to:
(setq insert-directory-program "/usr/local/bin/gls"
      dired-listing-switches "-alh --group-directories-first --ignore=.DS_Store")

; Make sure that Emacs uses the same PATH as zsh:
(let ((path (shell-command-to-string ". ~/.zshrc; echo -n $PATH")))
  (setenv "PATH" path)
  (setq exec-path (append (split-string-and-unquote path ":") exec-path)))
</pre>
