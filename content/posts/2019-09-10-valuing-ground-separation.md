title: "Valuing Ground Separation"

I can't remember where I first picked it up, but a saying claims, that one
should not try to save on things that separate you from the ground. This
includes footwear, tires, a bed or chairs. A close friend stopped buying cheap
shoes because of that saying. Another one bought a stone pine bed. And here I am
today, writing this while sitting on an [Aeron][aeron] office chair at home.
Buying an expensive office chair has been a personal on/off topic for several
years. I kept wondering again and again if such a chair would be "worth it", or
if I might "feel the price".

A few weeks ago, I stumbled over the website of a supplier which sells Herman
Miller products. Their office was in an okay-ish driving distance and so I paid
them a visit to try some chairs. A nice lady explained every little detail about
two products and so, for the first time after thinking about this topic for
years, I could sit on an Aeron. At first, I was disappointed. I had built up
this moment for so long, that I had expected "something more". But in this
moment, a hard truth hit me: It's just a chair. Suddenly, I had doubts. So I
dismissed this topic for several weeks, but it just wouldn't go away. After a
long thinking period and after talking with a few friends, I bought that
freaking chair. And let me tell you this: I love it. The obvious first thing
after arriving at home was to replace my previous chair. What I didn't expect
was this: after sitting in the new chair for maybe one hour, I unconsciously sat
down on the old chair after getting up. And oh boy did that feel wrong. Finally,
I got it. My previous mistake was that I did not compare a "normal" chair with
something in the price range of an Aeron. Now most other chairs just feel
inferior, which is a weird situation as I'm not insane enough to buy several of
these bad boys. That's a curse I now have to carry.

A few final notes to finish this off: Obviously, an Aeron is not the best chair
in the history of mankind. Other (and more affordable) chairs exist, so get
whatever you feel comfortable with. Keep in mind that sitting for long periods
of times is unhealthy, even if you have the most amazing chair. So try to get up
often, take a walk, grab something to drink or just stare out the window while
stretching.
