#+TITLE: Emacs on a MacBook
#+DATE: [2024-01-22]

The last couple of months I have been using a MacBook as a development machine.
This was the first time that I have used MacOS for more than a few minutes.
Installing Emacs was easy using the package manager Homebrew, but it took me a
couple of days to figure out all customization that I need to be comfortable. So
if you are a Windows/Linux user and feel lost (just like I did), this might be
useful to you:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
; Change modifier keys so that they are similar to Windows/Linux:
(setq mac-option-modifier nil
      mac-command-modifier 'meta)

; MacOS has a different version of ls compared to GNU ls. You can install "gls"
; using HomeBrew. After that you can configure dired the way you want to:
(setq insert-directory-program "/usr/local/bin/gls"
      dired-listing-switches "-alh --group-directories-first --ignore=.DS_Store")

; Make sure that Emacs uses the same PATH as zsh:
(let ((path (shell-command-to-string ". ~/.zshrc; echo -n $PATH")))
  (setenv "PATH" path)
  (setq exec-path (append (split-string-and-unquote path ":") exec-path)))
#+end_src
