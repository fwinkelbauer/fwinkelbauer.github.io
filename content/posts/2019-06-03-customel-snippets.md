title: "Custom.el Snippets"
date: 2019-06-03

My Emacs configuration contains a `custom.el` file, which should contain custom
code, that is only relevant on a specific machine. That's why this file is not
tracked via git. More and more bits of useful snippets show up in my `custom.el`
file and I'd like to jot down some examples which I might expand on in the
future.

## Calling Command Line Tools

This snippet is inspired by [a blog post][hackeryarn] which I've found on
/r/emacs. The elisp function calls the PowerShell function `Invoke-Formatter`,
which is part of the [PSScriptAnalyzer][analyzer] PowerShell module:

``` emacs-lisp
(defun fw/pspretty-buffer ()
  (interactive)
  (shell-command-on-region (point-min) (point-max) "powershell.exe -Command \"$script = $input | Out-String; Invoke-Formatter $script\" " t t))
```

## Org-Mode Agenda

After seeing [this post][showcase], I've decided to dive into creating my own
agenda. I'm using a custom agenda view to keep track of things I have to do
while I am at work. The custom view show my scheduled tasks for the next three
days, as well as all unscheduled tasks, sorted by their TODO statement (e.g.
"TODO", "WAIT" or "DONE"):

``` emacs-lisp
(setq org-agenda-custom-commands
      '(("." "Overview (Custom)"
         ((agenda ""
                  ((org-agenda-span 3)
                   (org-agenda-start-on-weekday nil)
                   (org-agenda-show-future-repeats 'next)
                   (org-agenda-scheduled-leaders '("" ""))
                   (org-agenda-overriding-header "* Calendar\n")))
          (todo ""
                ((org-agenda-overriding-header "\n* Open\n")
                 (org-agenda-block-separator nil)
                 (org-agenda-sorting-strategy '(todo-state-up))
                 (org-agenda-todo-ignore-scheduled 'all)))
          ))))

(set-face-attribute 'org-agenda-structure nil :inherit 'default :height 1.25)
```

The custom headers make the agenda look like a regular org-mode file. Enabling
`(orgstruct-mode)` on the agenda buffer allows me to hide and show sections.

I haven't come around to like `org-capture`, so for now I've created this:

``` emacs-lisp
(defun fw/home ()
  (interactive)
  (delete-other-windows)
  (find-file "~/org/projects.org")
  (split-window-horizontally)
  (other-window 1)
  (org-agenda nil ".")
  (split-window-vertically)
  (other-window 1)
  (find-file (concat "~/org/" (format-time-string "%Y-%m-%d") ".org"))
  (other-window 1))

(global-set-key (kbd "<f12>") 'fw/home)
```

Pressing `F12` opens up my "home" view, which consists of my projects-overview
file, my custom agenda, as well as a date stamped file which I use to keep track
of unexpected issues, thoughts and ideas.
