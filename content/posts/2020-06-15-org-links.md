title: "Even Better Emacs Org-Mode Links"

In a [previous blog post][orglink] I talked about how I am using org-mode links
to create shortcuts for accessing my projects. The outlined solution was using
link shortcuts with custom elisp code. While this is a valid solution, clicking
such a link prompts you for a "would you like to run this code?" confirmation,
which is annoying. There is a variable to avoid this popup, but using it is a
questionable decision regarding security. I'd rather not run (potentially) any
code when clicking on a link in an org-mode file.

I stumbled over [a post][kitchingroup] about org-mode v9 (published in 2016)
which contains a lot of examples on what you can do with custom links. So here's
my improved setup:

``` emacs-lisp
(defun fw/open-git (path)
  "Opens magit and neotree at `path'"
  (neotree-dir path)
  (other-window 1)
  (magit-status path))

(org-add-link-type "git" 'fw/open-git)
```

Which can be used like this:

``` org
* [[git:D:/Projects/SomeProject][Some Project]]

** TODO Something Important
```

These links are nothing groundbreaking, but I find them to be really convenient.
I can have a look at my TODO list and when I feel like tackling a particular
project, I just click the header to jump right into the action.
