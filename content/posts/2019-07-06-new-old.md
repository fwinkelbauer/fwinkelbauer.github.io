Sometimes, you discover something, that others have known for a long time. Last
week, I've discovered how useful a `~/bin` directory can be.

## Linux

After creating a `~/bin` directory on my Ubuntu machine, the directory is
already part of the `PATH` variable. Any executable or script put in the `~/bin`
directory can be turned into a global available command after changing
permissions and reloading the profile:

``` shell
mkdir ~/bin
cp /path/to/script ~/bin
chmod +x ~/bin/script
. ~/.profile
```

## Windows

I had to manually add `~/bin` to the `PATH` variable:

``` powershell
$homeBinDir = Join-Path $env:USERPROFILE 'bin'
New-Item $homeBinDir -ItemType Directory -Force | Out-Null
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('Path', [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('Path', 'User') + ';' + $homeBinDir, 'User')
```

Windows uses two different shells: `cmd.exe` and `powershell.exe`. You can use
`.bat`, `.cmd` and `.ps1` scripts in PowerShell, but you cannot use `.ps1` in
Cmd. Because of this, I've written a simple "wrapper script" which I can use to
make a `.ps1` script available in Cmd:

``` cmd
@ECHO OFF
PowerShell.exe -NoProfile -File "%~dpn0.ps1"
```

This `.cmd` script will call a `.ps1` with the same name (e.g. `foo.cmd` will
call `foo.ps1`). Such a script can also be used to start a `.ps1` script as an
Administrator in a new process:

``` cmd
@ECHO OFF
PowerShell.exe -NoProfile -Command "& {Start-Process PowerShell.exe -ArgumentList '-NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ""%~dpn0.ps1""' -Verb RunAs}"
```

Running `foo` in:

- a Cmd session will execute `foo.cmd`
- a PowerShell session will execute `foo.ps1` (or `foo.cmd` if `foo.ps1` cannot be found)

# Usage Examples

So we've got our bin directory set up, now what? Well, here's a short list of
scripts which I'm using on my machines:

- **my-pull:** Calls `git pull` on a bunch of different repositories. This makes
  it easy to download changes across several projects
- **my-rsync:** A custom "backup" script which relies on `rsync` to copy a snapshot of
  several directories to an external drive
- **my-robo:** Same as above, but using `robocopy.exe` on Windows
- **my-restic:** An experimental (real backup) script which uses `restic`
- **homebank-import:** A script which transforms CSV export files from my bank
  to a CSV format which I can import in `homebank`
