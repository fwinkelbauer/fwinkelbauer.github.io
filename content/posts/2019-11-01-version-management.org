#+TITLE: Dealing with Version Information
#+DATE: [2019-11-01]

About two years ago I was using a tool called [[https://github.com/ploeh/ZeroToNine][zero29]] to update =AssemblyInfo.cs=
files in my C# projects. The author Mark Seemann (who's talks I can highly
recommend) declined my request to add support for [[https://github.com/ploeh/ZeroToNine/issues/24][.nuspec files]]. His point was,
that zero29 is a tool to manage =AssemblyInfo.cs= files and that's all it should
ever do. While I am a big proponent of the Unix philosophy, I wished that zero29
would act as a tool to manage version information across all kinds of files.
This would (in my opinion) still be in line with the Unix philosophy, as there
are tools such as awk, grep or sed which do "one thing", but that "one thing" is
defined in a generalized context. So I jumped down the rabbit hole and built
[[https://github.com/fwinkelbauer/Bumpy][Bumpy]].

I had a lot of fun writing Bumpy. I took the time to "make it right", so I wrote
several unit tests, created a fully automated build process and I even took the
time to write some form of documentation, as well as an [[https://github.com/cake-contrib/Cake.Bumpy/][addin]] (an extension) for
the C# build tool [[https://cakebuild.net/][Cake]]. Inspired by [[https://editorconfig.org/][editorconfig's]] configuration I was trying to
create a config file in which I could define where to find version information
in different files. I kept observing the download statistics on [[https://www.nuget.org/packages/Bumpy/][NuGet.org]] as
well as [[https://chocolatey.org/packages/bumpy.portable][Chocolatey.org]] daily and I was really hyped when I received my [[https://github.com/fwinkelbauer/Bumpy/pull/25][very
first pull request]].

The latest commit on the Bumpy project was in June 2018. I realized that while I
was trying to build the project right, I was in reality not building the right
project. A core concept of Bumpy was to understand different version schemas and
some people even suggested that I should detect versions that are scattered
among [[https://github.com/cake-contrib/Cake.Bumpy/issues/7][several lines of text]]. In the end, I decided that a different approach
seemed simpler and more flexible: Why not build a "search and replace text"
tool? So I wrote a prototype in Python, because its =.ini= library comes with a
ton of interesting features. This first version of "niles" used two config files
to describe where to find text snippets and to describe the desired content for
these snippets. After a while, I found it cumbersome to manage two files, so I
redesigned the tool, while also adding more commands. Here's the final script
together which a short example:

*hello.txt:*

#+begin_src text
Hello! My name is Florian. How are you?
#+end_src

*name.txt:*

#+begin_src text
My name is Florian.
#+end_src

*niles.ini:*

#+begin_src conf
# Python's .ini library comes with a ton of features such as referencing
# values or defined default values for other sections

[DEFAULT]
# Optional parameters. If not set, niles will use the default encoding and
# line ending defined by the operating system
_charset = utf-8
_end_of_line = crlf

[**/{hello,name}.txt]
_regex = My name is (?P<name>[A-za-z]+(\s[A-za-z]+)?)
first_name = Max
second_name = Mustermann
name = %(first_name)s %(second_name)s
#+end_src

Niles offers these commands:

- *files:* To show all files which match the defined glob patterns
- *values:* To list all values which are grabbed through the regular expressions
- *apply:* To replace all declared values

Running ~niles apply~ would create:

#+begin_src text
Hello! My name is Max Mustermann. How are you?
#+end_src

and

#+begin_src text
My name is Max Mustermann.
#+end_src

Here's a final example of a config file which can be used to manage versions in
C# projects:

*niles.ini (C#):*

#+begin_src conf
[DEFAULT]
major = 5
minor = 10
patch = 0

[**/AssemblyInfo.cs]
_regex = ^\[assembly: Assembly(File)?Version\("(?P<assembly_version>.+)"\)\]$
assembly_version = %(major)s.%(minor)s.%(patch)s.0

[**/*.nuspec]
_regex = ^\s*<version>(?P<semantic_version>.+)<\/version>$
semantic_version = %(major)s.%(minor)s.%(patch)s
#+end_src

So, is this the "right" approach? To be honest, I'm not sure. At the moment I
like the simplicity of a search and replace tool compared to a elaborate tool
which can perform specific operations on versions.
