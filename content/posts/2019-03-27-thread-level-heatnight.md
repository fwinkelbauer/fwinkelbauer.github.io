In the past I've had a few occasions where I had to create a [WiX][wix]
installer for a C# project. But independent of whatever Google search query I
tried, I simply could not figure out how to use `heat.exe` to auto-generate the
content of my `.msi` files. Luckily, because of this lovely [StackOverflow
post][stack], this time was different. I'll cite the steps mentioned in this
post so that I'll hopefully never forget them:

> Define the Harvestpath for Heat:

 ``` xml
 <PropertyGroup>
   <DefineConstants>HarvestPath=..\Deploy</DefineConstants>
 </PropertyGroup>
 ```

> Heat will create a .wxs file. So we need to add this file to the compile
> ItemGroup:

 ``` xml
 <ItemGroup>
   <Compile Include="Product.wxs" /> <!-- This will be your default one -->
   <Compile Include="HeatGeneratedFileList.wxs" /> <!-- This is the Heat created one -->
 </ItemGroup>
 ```

> Then execute Heat in the BeforeBuild build target:

 ``` xml
 <Target Name="BeforeBuild">
   <HeatDirectory Directory="..\Deploy"
     PreprocessorVariable="var.HarvestPath"
     OutputFile="HeatGeneratedFileList.wxs"
     ComponentGroupName="HeatGenerated"
     DirectoryRefId="INSTALLFOLDER"
     AutogenerateGuids="true"
     ToolPath="$(WixToolPath)"
     SuppressFragments="true"
     SuppressRegistry="true"
     SuppressRootDirectory="true" />
 </Target>
 ```

> This will generate the HeatGeneratedFileList.wxs every time the WIX installer
> is built. The directory ..\Deploy has to be set to the directory of the files
> to include. The only thing we have to do to include these files in our
> installer is to edit the main .wxs file (like Product.wxs in this example).
> Heat will create a ComponentGroup with the given name from above. This
> component needs to be referenced in the Feature section of the Product.wxs:

 ``` xml
 <Feature Id="ProductFeature" Title="DiBA Tool" Level="1">
   <...>
   <ComponentGroupRef Id="HeatGenerated" />
 </Feature>
 ```

The above steps worked perfectly, but I had to write some additional code so
that I could extract the version information of my "main `.exe` file" (which is
contained in `HeatGeneratedFileList.wxs`). Each file in the heat generated list
has an ID, which in my case looked like this:
`fil672A180CB079EF052CD394C3B527E0A9`. This ID can be used to reference the
version information (e.g. v1.2.3.4) in my `Product.wxs` file:

``` xml
<?define ProductVersion=!(bind.FileVersion.fil672A181CB6794D058CDE94C6B527E0F9) ?>
```

``` xml
<Product Id="*" Name="MyApp" Language="1033" Version="$(var.ProductVersion)" Manufacturer="MyCompany" UpgradeCode="ffc26465-f32c-4848-acbf-e896c4095236">
```
