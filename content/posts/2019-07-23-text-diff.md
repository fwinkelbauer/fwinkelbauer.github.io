title: "Diffing Collaborative Text"

A [common advice][wookai] I've read in the past suggests, that we should write
text documents (like LaTeX documents or Markdown documentation) in a way, so
that each sentence is put on its own line. This gives us an easier time to
create diffs of documents which are created in a collaborative fashion.

Emacs offers a function `fill-paragraph`, which breaks a given line before a
specific column width. This might look like this:

``` text

```

`fill-paragraph` looks decent, but it can create massive diffs which are hard to
reason about. There are several questions on StackOverflow (such as [this
one][stackoverflow] where people ask for a customized version of
`fill-paragraph` which could format a piece of text, so that each sentence is
put onto a new line. I've recently started to read the Emacs Lisp introduction
tutorial (which ships with Emacs itself), so I've tried to come up with my own
solution to this problem. I took some inspiration from the above StackOverflow
post. Here's the code:

``` emacs-lisp
(defun fw/unfill-paragraph ()
  "Unfill the paragraph at point."
  (interactive)
  (let ((fill-column (point-max)))
    (fill-paragraph)))

(defun fw/wrap-at-sentences ()
  "Fills the current paragraph, but starts each sentence on a new line."
  (interactive)
  (save-excursion
    (fw/unfill-paragraph)
    (mark-paragraph)
    (while (< (point) (region-end))
      (forward-sentence)
      ;; We don't want the add a new line at the end of the paragraph
      (if (< (+ (point) 1) (region-end))
          (newline-and-indent))))
  ;; The selection will not be cleared if there is only one sentence in a paragraph
  (deactivate-mark))
```

The above code works for the most part, but there are still two edge cases which
annoy me:

Emacs might treat phrases such as "e.g." or "i.e." as the end of a sentence,
which means that a single sentence might end up on more than one line. This
behavior can change depending on the configuration of your
`sentence-end-double-space` variable, but we can still create examples in which
`forward-sentence` does not behave as it should. Here's an example:

``` text
This sentence, which contains the phrase
e.g.
and because of how the new lines are put,
Emacs intereprets it as two sentences.
```

The `markdown-mode` package has ambiguous behavior regarding lists. Depending on
what operations you perform, a list might be formatted in two different ways.
This can be visualized using an example:

Here's the initial text on one line:

``` text
- Some example sentence which contains no content. Another pointless example sentence. A third sentence.
```

If we put a new line right after every sentence, the text will end up like this:

``` text
- Some example sentence which contains no content.
Another pointless example sentence.
A third sentence.
```

If we instead indent the second sentence before we put a new line on every
following sentence, each following sentence will have the correct indentation:

``` text
- Some example sentence which contains no content.
  Another pointless example sentence.
  A third sentence.
```

Both versions seem to be valid Markdown (well, at least for every interpreter
that I've tried), but I'd still prefer the second version.
