title: "Org-Mode Timer"

Org-mode appears to be one of those friends you have known for a long time but
for some reason you just keep stumbling upon new profound things you just didn't
know about them. I had this moment when I discovered timers. There are different
ways to clock work or to start an increasing or decreasing timer which are
described in the org-mode documentation [here][org-clock] and [here][org-timer].
These functions can be used to interact with a decreasing timer:

``` emacs-lisp
(org-timer-set-timer)
(org-timer-pause-or-continue)
(org-timer-stop)
```

While these timers are convenient, I was suprised that Emacs won't warn me about
a running timer when closing the application. Luckily adding a timer check only
takes a few lines of code:

``` emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'kill-emacs-query-functions
             (lambda ()
               (or (not (and (boundp 'org-timer-start-time)
                             org-timer-start-time))
                   (y-or-n-p "Quit with running org-timer?"))))
```

This little piece of code is called when closing Emacs. It will check if a timer
is still running and will ask you what to do about it.
