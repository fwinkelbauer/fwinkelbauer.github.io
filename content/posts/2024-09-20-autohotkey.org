[[https://www.autohotkey.com/][AutoHotkey]] is a great tool to do many sorts of cool automation tasks on Windows
that does not seem to be known well. Some of my developer friends have recently
picked up this little script language in our last company hackathon. Many years
ago I used to host a couple of my own scripts on ahk.florianwinkelbauer.com. The
subdomain and the scripts are long gone, but you can still find references to
them scattered over the web. One of my most proudest mentions was on [[https://lifehacker.com/droppub-sends-any-file-to-dropboxs-public-folder-and-co-5634056][Lifehacker]],
which overflowed my mailbox for a day.
