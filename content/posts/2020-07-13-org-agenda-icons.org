A few days ago [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/hnf3cw/my_orgmode_agenda_much_better_now_with_category/][this Reddit post]] about icons in the org-agenda view took me by
surprise. In the past I have tried to find ways to use different colors
depending on the context of a TODO item (without any success), but I never
thought about using icons (or that org-mode even supports category based icons).
I was even more impressed when a user called "asiledeneg" posted some elisp code
to use the all-the-icons Emacs package. Thank you kind internet strangers for
your code samples. You made my org-agenda glorious:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun fw/agenda-icon-material (name)
  "Returns an all-the-icons-material icon"
  (list (all-the-icons-material name)))

;; https://old.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/hnf3cw/my_orgmode_agenda_much_better_now_with_category/
(setq org-agenda-category-icon-alist
      `(("Birthday" ,(fw/agenda-icon-material "cake") nil nil :ascent center)
        ("Anniversary" ,(fw/agenda-icon-material "favorite") nil nil :ascent center)))
#+end_src
