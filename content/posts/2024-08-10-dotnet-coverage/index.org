#+TITLE: Dotnet Coverage for Manual Tests
#+DATE: [2024-08-10]

Code coverage tools are a well known way to find untested code when working with
automated tests. I have recently learned that these tools can also be used when
performing manual tests. I know, it sounds obvious, but for some reason I have
never even considered it. And it turns out that its incredible easy to do using
[[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/additional-tools/dotnet-coverage][dotnet-coverage]]. The official repository contains a few sweet [[https://github.com/microsoft/codecoverage/blob/main/samples/Calculator/scenarios/scenario08/README.md][examples]].

Here is another one:

#+begin_src sh
# Setup
git clone https://github.com/fwinkelbauer/chunkyard
cd chunkyard/src/Chunkyard
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-coverage
dotnet build

# Start coverage
dotnet-coverage collect --session-id my-session --server-mode --background --include-files **/*.dll

# Perform manual tests
dotnet run -- store --help
dotnet run -- store --repository example --paths . --preview

# Create coverage report "output.coverage"
dotnet-coverage shutdown my-session
#+end_src
