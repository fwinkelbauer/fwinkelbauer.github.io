I got interested in theater after participating in a [[http://www.somak.at/][musical course]] back
in 2014. Since then I've taken a few other courses, including clown theater. In
2019 I had the opportunity to be part of a newcomer show at the lovely [[https://www.theater-ole.at/][Theater
Olé]], Vienna's first and only clown theater.

Here's the full list:
