Hi, welcome to my website! I blog about my opinions and experiences on software
development and about whatever else seems to catch my interest. In my free time
I tinker with small projects on [[https://github.com/fwinkelbauer][GitHub]]. In the past I have been a clown on more
than one occasion. [[file:notes/theater.org][Literally]].

I am currently working at [[https://invenium.io/][Invenium]] where I deal with server infrastructure and
build pipelines. Before that I was automating whatever I could get my hands on
at [[https://intact-systems.com/][Intact]].

My wife, son and I live near Leibnitz, Austria. You can reach me at "mail@(this
domain)".
