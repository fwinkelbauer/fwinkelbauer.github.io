#+TITLE: Florian Winkelbauer

Hi, welcome to my website! I blog about my opinions and experiences on software
development and whatever else seems to catch my interest. In my free time I like
to tinker with [[./projects/index.org][small projects]]. In the past I have been a clown on more than one
occasion. [[./notes/theater/index.org][Literally]].

I am currently working at [[https://intact-systems.com/][Intact]] where I try to automate whatever I can get my
hands on.

My wife, son and I live near Leibnitz, Austria. You can reach me at "mail" at
this domain.
