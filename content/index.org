#+TITLE: Florian Winkelbauer

Hi, welcome to my website! I blog about my opinions and experiences on software
development and about whatever else seems to catch my interest. In my free time
I tinker with small projects on [[https://github.com/fwinkelbauer][GitHub]]. In the past I have been a clown on more
than one occasion. [[/notes/theater][Literally]].

I am currently working at [[https://intact-systems.com/][Intact]] where I try to automate whatever I can get my
hands on.

My wife, son and I live near Leibnitz, Austria. You can reach me at "mail@(this
domain)".
