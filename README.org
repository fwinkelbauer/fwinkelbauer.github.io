This repository contains the [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] sources for my [[https://florianwinkelbauer.com][website]].

* Development

The following commands require Python and Emacs:

- Run ~./pls publish~ to populate the =public/= directory
- Run ~./pls serve~ to start a local web server on [[http://localhost:8000]] which
  serves =public/=
- Run ~./pls deploy~ to publish and deploy this website to [[https://github.com/fwinkelbauer/fwinkelbauer.github.io/tree/gh-pages][gh-pages]]
