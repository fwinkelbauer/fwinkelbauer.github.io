#+TITLE: Website

This repository contains the [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] sources for my [[https://florianwinkelbauer.com][website]].

* Development

The following commands require Python and Emacs:

- Run ~./make build~ to populate the ~public/~ directory
- Run ~./make serve~ to start a local web server on [[http://localhost:8000]] which
  serves ~public/~
- Run ~./make publish~ to build and publish/upload this website

A typical org-mode page found in this repository contains a header like this:

#+begin_src org
,#+TITLE: The Title
,#+DATE: [2000-12-24]
#+end_src
