When tape bands
fell out of fashion, durability was redefined as &ldquo;fsync to disk&rdquo;. With the rise
of distributed system, durability was redefined once more to mean replication.</p><p><strong>Consistency:</strong></p><ul><li>This is not the same C as in the CAP theorem</li><li>A database moves from one consistent state to the another through
transactions. A consistent state is defined through integrity checks or
invariants (e.g. the balance of an account cannot be negative)</li><li>It is a property of how the application uses the database, it is not a
property of the database itself</li></ul><p><strong>Atomicity:</strong></p><ul><li>&ldquo;All or nothing guarantee&rdquo;</li><li>It&rsquo;s about handling crashes/fault, not about concurrency! You either get all
or no parts of a transaction</li></ul><p><strong>Isolation:</strong></p><p>Serializable isolation means that the effects of concurrent transactions is as
though all transactions were performed in a serial (one after the other)
fashion. Each transaction feels as if it had the whole database for itself.</p><p>Databases have different default and maximum isolation levels. These levels are:</p><ul><li>Read Uncommitted</li><li>Read Committed:<ul><li>Dirty reads/writes are not allowed</li><li>Does not prevent Read Skew (see below). This is scary, as &ldquo;Read Committed&rdquo;
is the default isolation level for several databases</li></ul></li><li>Snapshot Isolation:<ul><li>Read skews are not allowed. If a transaction is reading the database, the
transaction sees the database at a specific point in time. Other
transactions do not interfere.</li><li>Does not prevent Write Skew</li></ul></li><li>Repeatable Read</li><li>Serializable<ul><li>Can prevent Write Skew</li><li>Some implementations use two-phase-locking (not two-phase-commit!), which
use shared locks. This can be problematic, as analytical queries lock the
whole databases.</li><li>Other solutions (which don&rsquo;t use shared locks) are H-Store and Serializable
Snapshot Isolation</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Race conditions:</strong></p><ul><li>Dirty Read: A transaction can read what another unfinished transaction wrote</li><li>Dirty Write: Concurrent writes to several tables can interfere with each other</li><li>Read Skew: Imagine a transaction which transfers 100 dollars from one account
to another. A backup process might read both accounts at different times (one
before a transaction, and one afterwards), which means that the backup now
contains inconsistent data</li><li>Write Skew:<ul><li>Pattern: Read something, make decision, write decision to database</li><li>Example: An ambulance system requires, that each shift has at least one
doctor on call. If several doctors request to go off call at the same time,
we can end up in a situation in which no doctor is on call. This can happen
because these concurrent transactions see the exact same snapshot of a
database</li><li>&ldquo;By the time the write is committed, the premise of the decision is no
longer true&rdquo;</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id=how-did-we-end-up-here-todd-montgomery--martin-thompsonhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvoxjt7veki9c><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxjT7veKi9c">How did we end up here (Todd Montgomery & Martin Thompson)</a></h2><ul><li>Focus on the fundamentals. Master them and understand them before you try
to change them</li><li>Shared mutable state is <strong>a complete nightmare</strong> and should only be used for
systems programming. The smartest people get this wrong all the time<ul><li>A cache is one the hardest problems in computer science. Do you <strong>really</strong>
want to implement it yourself?</li><li>Embrace append-only, single writer, and shared nothing designs</li></ul></li><li>Universal scalability law: You can&rsquo;t run away from math</li><li>Stop using text encoding. The web is in a constant &ldquo;debug mode&rdquo;</li><li>Synchronous communication is the crystal meth of distributed programming.
Remote Procedure Calls do not work</li><li>Object orientation and set theories are great models. Please don&rsquo;t use ORMs to
make them work together. If you don&rsquo;t understand SQL, please do not use a
database</li><li>&ldquo;The purpose of abstraction is not to be vague, but to create a new semantic

they are doing the world makes a lot more sense..&rdquo;</li></ul><h2 id=its-about-time-christin-gormanhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvnhhm5yc2hco><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nhhm5yC2HCo">It&rsquo;s about time (Christin Gorman)</a></h2><p>The basic time library in your favorite programming language might be horrible.
Why? Because they tend to mix two very different concepts:</p><ul><li>The linear progression of time</li><li>An interpretation of time, based on politics, astronomy and history</li></ul><p>What time is it? 1532428776. No, I mean what time is it? Well, that depends.
Which epoch do you mean?</p><table><thead><tr><th>Environment</th><th>Start</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.NET</td><td>1 Jan 0001</td></tr><tr><td>Windows</td><td>1 Jan 1601</td></tr><tr><td>Unix</td><td>1 Jan 1970</td></tr><tr><td>GPS</td><td>5 Jan 1980</td></tr></tbody></table><p>A timestamp on Windows means something completely different than a timestamp on
Unix!</p><p>Time synchronization (clock drift correction) is the reason why Windows does not
guarantee, that the system time increases monotonically. So you shouldn&rsquo;t use
it. Instead, use something different like the current tick count, or use your
own sequence number.</p><p>UTC (which stands for Coordinated Universal Time) is an effort to create a
system on which we can all agree.</p><p>Coding advice:</p><ul><li>Store timestamps as UTC together with a time zone</li><li>Do not store start/end timestamps. Instead, store a start timestamp together
with a duration. This makes it much easier to deal with events such as
day-light saving</li><li>Don&rsquo;t always mock out your database layer. The conversation of dates (which
can depend on the time zone of your database <strong>and</strong> on the time zone of your
operating system) will hunt you down</li><li>Make date ranges <strong>inclusive</strong> from and <strong>exclusive</strong> to (start &lt;= value &lt;

water at a specific temperature. So what do you do? You measure the error (e.g.
the water has 20°C, it should be 100°C, so the error is 80°C) and react with
correcting actions based on the error. To do this, we distinguish three types of
controllers:</p><h3 id=p-controller>P Controller</h3><ul><li>Takes proportional steps to correct an error (e.g. the applied heat is
proportional to the measured error)</li><li>These systems tend to oscillate around the desired state</li></ul><h3 id=pi-controller>PI Controller</h3><ul><li>Adds an integral to observe an error over time</li><li>Such a system still oscillates, but the overall error curve is flattened</li><li>Thermostats or cruise controls use PI systems</li><li>These systems cannot deal with shocks</li></ul><h3 id=pid-controller>PID Controller</h3><ul><li>Adds a derivative component to predict future errors</li></ul><h3 id=anti-patterns>Anti Patterns</h3><p>Using open loops is scary. The system cannot detect a problem. Chaos engineering
and observability are fine practices to find open loops. Open loop systems tend
to be imperative (do this, do that), while closed loop system tend to be
declarative (please get the system into my defined desired state).</p><p>Power laws are out to get you. A system failure can spread in an exponential
way. These failures can be kept in their cages by building smaller systems
(which decrease the overall &ldquo;blasting radius&rdquo;). Other techniques include:</p><ul><li>Exponential back-off</li><li>Rate-limiters</li></ul><p>Sudden load spikes can bring down a system. In general: keep your queues short.
LIFO queues might be a good idea, as they will prioritize new information.</p><p>Implementing edge triggered systems imply, that you have solved the &ldquo;deliver
just once&rdquo; problem. Level triggered (and idempotent) systems seem to be a
simpler solution.</p><h2 id=big-numbers-and-the-1hz-cpu-tom-hudsonhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvpdboc6i3k8g><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDBOC6I3K8g">Big Numbers and the 1Hz CPU (Tom Hudson)</a></h2><p>We do not have a good intuition for how fast different parts of a computer are.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s have a look at a 3ghz CPU and different access times:</p><ul><li>Register: 0.3ns</li><li>L1 cache: 1.5ns</li><li>L2 cache: 3ns</li><li>L3 cache 13ns</li><li>RAM: 0.1 microseconds</li><li>HDD: 6ms</li><li>SSD: 80 microseconds</li></ul><p>All these values seem &ldquo;low enough&rdquo;, but let&rsquo;s but them into perspective using a

It is also in charge of &ldquo;telling
our story&rdquo; in which we are identified as the hero. System 1 is prone to biases
such as:</p><ul><li><strong>Confirmation bias:</strong> We seek confirmation instead of information. We like to
stick to our point of view, even in the face of evidence which supports a
different point</li><li><strong>Cognitive dissonance:</strong> We have a hard time to keep two contradicting ideas
in our head</li><li><strong>Naive realism:</strong> We believe that we are rational and that a disagreeing part
will &ldquo;see&rdquo; if we present them &ldquo;our facts&rdquo;</li></ul><p>We overestimate our own understanding and underestimate the role of randomness
in our world. We seek for patterns and explanations, even if there aren&rsquo;t any.</p><p>System 2 can only focus for about 50 minutes (max) before taking a break.</p><p>We use System 2 to learn something new. Over time, a certain skill moves to
System 1 (e.g. walking, driving, or playing an instrument). After is has moved
to System 1, interference from System 2 can hurt our performance by
&ldquo;overthinking&rdquo;.</p><p>System 2 takes a lot of energy. Self control causes a drop in your blood
glucose. We have a limited pool of &ldquo;mental energy&rdquo;. This is why we tend to make
worse decisions when tired or hungry.</p><p>System 2 believes that it runs the show, but System 1 is in charge! And that&rsquo;s
good. You don&rsquo;t want to trust a system which lets you forget your keys to care
about essential tasks such as breathing.</p><p><strong>Better Meetings:</strong></p><ul><li>Water, tea, coffee available</li><li>Standing should be OK</li><li>Very small groups</li><li>Limit meeting times to ~40 minutes. For longer meetings, take a different seat
