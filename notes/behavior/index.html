Pink)</h2><h3 id=chapter-1>Chapter 1</h3><ul><li>Timing is not an art, it&rsquo;s a science.</li><li>Do <strong>not</strong> go to the hospital in the afternoon. Seriously. Don&rsquo;t.</li></ul><p>Our cognitive abilities change over the course of a day. Even if we think that
&ldquo;this does not apply to us&rdquo;, these forces have a greater impact than we believe.
We can split a day into three mood phases:</p><ul><li>Peak</li><li>Through</li><li>Recovery</li></ul><p>The order in which we move through these phases depends on our chronotype. We
distinguish between larks, third birds and owls.</p><ul><li>Larks and third birds: peak, trough, recovery</li><li>Owls: recovery, trough, peak</li></ul><table><thead><tr><th>State</th><th>Task</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Peak</td><td>Analytic</td></tr><tr><td>Trough</td><td>Administrative</td></tr><tr><td>Recovery</td><td>Insight</td></tr></tbody></table><ul><li><strong>Analytic:</strong> You want to get rid of distractions. Do tasks that require focus
and vigilance</li><li><strong>Administrative:</strong> Your mood drops. Do the &ldquo;boring stuff&rdquo;</li><li><strong>Insight:</strong> Your mood is recovering. You are more inclined to say yes. Do
tasks that require you to be creative</li></ul><p>To do better in the morning:</p><ul><li>Drink a glass of water after waking up</li><li>Avoid coffee right after waking up</li><li>Soak up the morning sun</li></ul><h3 id=chapter-2>Chapter 2</h3><p>Effective breaks:</p><ul><li>Work for 52 minutes and then break for 17 minutes</li><li>Moving beats stationary</li><li>Take breaks in company, but do not talk about work related issues</li><li>Go outside</li><li>Do not use your phone to check mails or social media</li><li>Schedule breaks just like you would schedule a meeting</li></ul><p>Lunch is the most important meal of the day. Avoid the &ldquo;sad desk lunch&rdquo;.</p><p>Effective naps:</p><ul><li>Between 10 and 20 minutes</li><li>Drink a cup of coffee right before taking a nap</li><li>The Mayo clinic says that the best time for a nap is between 14:00 and 15:00</li><li>Turn it into a habit. If you cannot do that, take a nap when you did not get
enough sleep, our your day feels more stressful than usual</li></ul><h2 id=john-cleese-on-creativity-in-managementhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvpb5oiipo62g><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5oIIPO62g">John Cleese on Creativity in Management</a></h2><p><strong>Open Mode</strong> (the creative mode)</p><ul><li>&ldquo;The ability to play&rdquo;</li><li>Play for your own enjoyment, curiosity because of its own sake</li><li>We are relaxed, inclined to humor and more playful</li></ul><p><strong>Close Mode</strong></p><ul><li>The &ldquo;default mode&rdquo; when we are at work</li><li>We are impatient, purposeful</li></ul><p>We need the &ldquo;open mode&rdquo; to find a way and we need the &ldquo;closed mode&rdquo; to follow
through with our plans. We are the most efficient when we switch between these
two modes. The problem: We tend to get stuck in the &ldquo;closed mode&rdquo;.</p><p>There are conditions that make it more likely to get into the &ldquo;open mode&rdquo;:</p><ul><li><strong>Space</strong><ul><li>You need an undisturbed environment</li></ul></li><li><strong>Time</strong><ul><li>Have a specific time in which you are operating in your undisturbed
environment</li><li>It takes some time before your mind starts to quiet down</li><li>Take about an hour and a half, not longer</li><li>You have to stick to a problem in order to find an original solution</li></ul></li><li><strong>Confidence</strong><ul><li>&ldquo;Whatever happens is ok&rdquo;. While you are creative, nothing is wrong</li></ul></li><li><strong>Humor</strong><ul><li>Is an essential part to be creative</li></ul></li></ul><p>Other people can help us to be more creative, but only if they make us feel
good. There is no place for &ldquo;No&rdquo;, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like that&rdquo; or &ldquo;You are wrong&rdquo;.</p><h2 id=how-to-fail-at-almost-everything-and-still-win-big-scott-adams>How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big (Scott Adams)</h2><h3 id=happiness-formula>Happiness Formula</h3><ul><li>Eat right</li><li>Exercise</li><li>Get enough sleep</li><li>Imagine an incredible future</li><li>Work toward a flexible schedule</li><li>Do things you can steadily improve at</li><li>Help others (if you&rsquo;ve already helped yourself)</li><li>Reduce daily decisions to routine</li></ul><h3 id=business-writing>Business Writing</h3><ul><li>No passive</li><li>Main message in first sentence</li><li>Who, what, when, where, why, how</li><li>Read it twice (corrections)</li><li>Read it twice (meaning, wait before you read it again)</li><li>Less is more</li></ul><h2 id=healthy-eatinghttpwwwgrubstreetcom201803ultimate-conversation-on-healthy-eating-and-nutritionhtml><a href=http://www.grubstreet.com/2018/03/ultimate-conversation-on-healthy-eating-and-nutrition.html>Healthy Eating</a></h2><ul><li><strong>Gist:</strong> Whole foods, minimally processed, mostly plants, and plain water</li><li>Emphasize on vegetables, fruits, whole grains, beans, lentils, nuts, seeds,
and plain water for thirst. That can be with or without seafood; with or
without dairy; with or without eggs; with or without some meat; high or low in
total fat</li><li>All the Blue Zone diets - the diets around the world associated with longevity
and vitality - contain beans.

is added to an ingredient list.

People might outperform others
in certain areas, but they can be &ldquo;normal&rdquo; in other areas</li><li>Introverts tend to not remember details. Instead they remember how they felt
or what their opinion was in that situation</li><li>We change old memories all the time. We generalize and filter. That&rsquo;s what our
brains do. It&rsquo;s a healthy process</li><li>Therapy focuses on interpreting past events in a different light</li></ul><h3 id=the-dunning-kruger-effect-episode-192>The Dunning-Kruger Effect (Episode #192)</h3><ul><li>We can be so incompetent that we don&rsquo;t even realize how incompetent we are</li><li>You want a confident general leading a battle, but you want an unconfident
general when planning the battle</li><li>Naysayers can be valuable to find situations in which you are too confident</li><li>Reflect on your previous work/thoughts 5-10 years ago. Do you like what you
did?

larger projects</li><li>Mission: &ldquo;What is my goal in my (working) life?&rdquo;</li></ul><h3 id=avoid-flow-do-what-does-not-come-easy>Avoid Flow. Do What Does Not Come Easy</h3><p>The mistake most weak pianists make is playing, not practicing. If you walk into
a music hall at a local university, you&rsquo;ll hear people &ldquo;playing&rdquo; by
running through their pieces. This is a huge mistake. Strong pianists drill the
most difficult parts of their music, rarely, if ever playing through their
pieces in entirety.</p><h3 id=to-master-a-skill-master-something-harder>To Master a Skill, Master Something Harder</h3><p>Strong pianists find clever ways to &ldquo;complicate&rdquo; the difficult parts of
their music. If we have problem playing something with clarity, we complicate by
playing the passage with alternating accent patterns. If we have problems with
speed, we confound the rhythms.</p><h3 id=systematically-eliminate-weakness>Systematically Eliminate Weakness</h3><p>Strong pianists know our weaknesses and use them to create strength. I have
sharp ears, but I am not as in touch with the physical component of piano
playing. So, I practice on a mute keyboard</p><h3 id=create-beauty-dont-avoid-ugliness>Create Beauty, Don&rsquo;t Avoid Ugliness</h3><p>Weak pianists make music a reactive task, not a creative task. They start, and
react to their performance, fixing problems as they go along. Strong pianists,
on the other hand, have an image of what a perfect performance should be like
that includes all of the relevant senses. Before we sit down, we know what the
piece needs to feel, sound, and even look like in excruciating detail. In
performance, weak pianists try to reactively move away from mistakes, while
strong pianists move towards a perfect mental image</p><h3 id=deliberate-practice>Deliberate Practice</h3><ul><li>Immediate feedback</li><li>Training to your limits</li><li>Technique over outcomes</li></ul><p>Apply this through:</p><ul><li>Establishing a <strong>deliberate</strong> practice time</li><li>Keep a skill journal to identify weak areas</li><li>Use practice to break your (bad) habits using new methods and techniques</li></ul><h2 id=the-tao-of-coaching-max-landsberg>The Tao of Coaching (Max Landsberg)</h2><table><thead><tr><th></th><th><strong>Low Skill</strong></th><th><strong>High Skill</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>High Will</strong></td><td>Guide</td><td>Delegate</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Low Will</strong></td><td>Direct</td><td>Excite</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id=triggers-marshall-goldsmith>Triggers (Marshall Goldsmith)</h2><h3 id=four-stages-of-a-feedback-loops>Four Stages of a Feedback Loops</h3><ul><li>Evidence (seeing how fast you are driving)</li><li>Relevance (you know that you are too fast)</li><li>Consequences (you might get a ticket)</li><li>Action (so you reduce your speed)</li></ul><h3 id=two-truths>Two Truths</h3><ol><li>Meaningful behavioral change is very hard to do</li><li>No one can make us change unless we truly want to change</li></ol><h3 id=snippets>Snippets</h3><ul><li>Our environment influences our behavior more than we might think.
<strong>Example:</strong> You behave different when you are standing in traffic</li><li>We are inaccurate in assessing ourselves</li><li>We are great planners, but reluctant doers</li><li>A trigger is only a problem if our reaction creates a problem</li><li>There are areas in our life in which we think that we can &ldquo;just wing it&rdquo;</li><li>We need help when we are least likely to get it. We behave against our own
interest and might not even realize it.</li><li>&ldquo;We are professionals at what we do, amateurs at what we want to become.&rdquo;</li></ul><h3 id=the-wheel-of-change>The Wheel of Change</h3><ul><li><strong>Creating:</strong> A positive element that we want to create</li><li><strong>Elimination:</strong> A positive element that we want to keep</li><li><strong>Accepting:</strong> A negative element that we need to accept</li><li><strong>Preserving:</strong> A negative element that we want to eliminate</li></ul><h3 id=types-of-triggers>Types of Triggers</h3><ul><li><strong>Encouraging:</strong> We want it</li><li><strong>Productive:</strong> We need it</li><li><strong>Discouraging:</strong> We don&rsquo;t want it</li><li><strong>Counter-Productive:</strong> We don&rsquo;t need it</li></ul><p>These four categories form a rectangle which can describe several types of
behavior. <strong>Example:</strong> Temptation (&ldquo;We want it, but don&rsquo;t need it&rdquo;).</p><p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Pick a behavior goal you are pursuing. Now list all the people
and situations that influence the quality of your performance. Identify and
label the triggers related to your goal.</p><h3 id=active-questions>Active Questions</h3><ul><li>Passive questions (&ldquo;Do you have clear goals?") allow us to take a free pass,
meaning that we can blame someone else for a problem (&ldquo;Oh my manager just
doesn&rsquo;t know what he wants!").</li><li>Active questions (&ldquo;Did I do my best today to set clear goals for myself&rdquo;) put
us into the driver seat. This type of question makes us accountable and asks
us to defend our actions. They motivate us &ldquo;to try&rdquo;.</li><li>Rate yourself on your active questions between 1 (low) and 10 (highest).
Report your score regularly.</li><li>If your scores keep sinking, decide: Do I want to drop this question, or
should I try harder?</li><li>These active questions can be used with an hourly reminder for short burst
applications (e.g. working with an &ldquo;annoying&rdquo; colleague)</li></ul></article></main><footer><p>Copyright 2022, Florian Winkelbauer. All rights reserved.</p></footer></body></html>
