Why? Risks?</li><li>What other things have you considered? Why didn&rsquo;t you choose them?</li></ul><p>Michael Nygard described his decision log structure in <a href=https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions>this blog
post</a>:</p><ul><li><strong>Context:</strong> Describe the forces at play</li><li><strong>Decision:</strong> Your response to these forces</li><li><strong>Status:</strong> The decision status (e.g. &ldquo;proposed&rdquo;)</li><li><strong>Consequences:</strong> What happened afterwards?</li></ul><h2 id=how-to-deal-with-configuration>How To Deal With Configuration</h2><ul><li>Rely on useful default configuration which is stored inside the application:<ul><li>e.g. using a log folder next to the application folder, using default
schedule timers, etc.</li><li>Maybe it would make sense to create a default configuration file if it does
not exist</li></ul></li><li>Allow external configuration via several sources. They can override each
other:<ul><li>Default values stored in the application</li><li>Configuration files</li><li>Command line arguments</li><li>Environment variables</li></ul></li><li>Throw a meaningful error on configuration problems</li><li>Try to initialize resources if they are not found (e.g. create directories,
create files, &mldr;)</li><li>Create application arguments which allows a user to specify a configuration
file in a specific place</li><li>Some configuration (e.g. plugging an application into a logging service) should
be disabled by default. A user can enable them if he wants to</li></ul><h1 id=documentation>Documentation</h1><ul><li><a href=https://arc42.org/documentation/>https://arc42.org/documentation/</a></li><li>Write documentation if<ul><li>The thing you are documenting does not change often</li><li>Your documentation will be useful to a large group of people</li></ul></li><li><a href=https://www.writethedocs.org/videos/eu/2017/the-four-kinds-of-documentation-and-why-you-need-to-understand-what-they-are-daniele-procida/>Four Kinds of Documentation</a><ul><li><strong>Tutorial:</strong> learning-oriented; a getting started guide</li><li><strong>How-To Guide:</strong> goal-oriented; how to solve a specific problem</li><li><strong>Explanation:</strong> understanding-oriented; provides background and context</li><li><strong>Reference:</strong> information-oriented; describes inner processes</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id=chaos-engineering>Chaos Engineering</h2><p>Adding parameters for sleep timers and error rates to service requests can be an

The build script offers ways to
create and delete a database based on a configuration file (which is not put
into version control). This configuration file contains the database name as
well as a connection string</li><li>Migration scripts (and test data) are put into version control</li></ul><h2 id=the-phoenixunicorn-project-gene-kim>The Phoenix/Unicorn Project (Gene Kim)</h2><p>Three Ways</p><ul><li>System Thinking</li><li>Amplify Feedback Loops</li><li>Culture Of Continual Experimentation And Learning</li></ul><p>Five Types Of Work</p><ul><li>Business Projects</li><li>Internal IT Projects</li><li>Changes generated by the above</li><li>Unplanned Work</li></ul><p>Five Ideals</p><ul><li>Locality and Simplicity</li><li>Focus, Flow, and Joy</li><li>Improvement of Daily Work</li><li>Psychological Safety</li><li>Customer Focus</li></ul><h2 id=accelerate-nicole-forsgren-phd-jez-humble-and-gene-kim>Accelerate (Nicole Forsgren PhD, Jez Humble and Gene Kim)</h2><p>The book outlines 24 capabilities that drive improvements software delivery

distributed system can either favor consistency or availability.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Imagine that you are part of a fully remote wedding. Let&rsquo;s imagine
that you answer &ldquo;the big question&rdquo; with yes and let&rsquo;s imagine that your
phone/internet connection breaks before your significant other can answer the
same question. What do you do? Do you say that you are married/not married (in
which case you would favor availability) or do you say &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo; (in which
case you would favor consistency).</p><p>The PACELC theorem is an extension to the CAP theorem: In case of a network
<strong>P</strong>artition, one has to choose between <strong>A</strong>vailability and <strong>C</strong>onsistency,
<strong>E</strong>lse, when a system does not have a partition, one has to choose between
<strong>L</strong>atency and <strong>C</strong>onsistency.</p><p>Martin Kleppmann posted an <a href=https://martin.kleppmann.com/2015/05/11/please-stop-calling-databases-cp-or-ap.html>interesting article</a> in which he explains
that neither CAP nor PACELC are a good way to think about distributed systems.</p><h2 id=idealcast-podcasthttpsitrevolutioncomthe-idealcast-podcast><a href=https://itrevolution.com/the-idealcast-podcast/>Idealcast Podcast</a></h2><h3 id=jeffrey-fredrick-episode-14>Jeffrey Fredrick (Episode 14)</h3><p>Employee satisfaction can indicate the performance of an organization. Ask:</p><ul><li>Are you happy?</li><li>Are you able to do work that you are proud of?</li></ul><h3 id=scott-havens-episode-22--23>Scott Havens (Episode 22 & 23)</h3><ul><li>State management techniques used in functional programming can be used to
scale large architecture such as Wal-Mart&rsquo;s warehouse system</li><li>Working with event streams as input and output makes a system decoupled,
easier to test and more understandable</li><li>A pure function can be replaced by a lookup table</li><li>Scott mentions a story about how they recovered from a disaster involving the
death of a Kafka cluster</li><li>He also tells the story of how he replaced a synchronous call graph involving
23 procedures with asynchronous computation</li><li>Category theory is not too important in your day-to-day use of functional
patterns</li></ul><h2 id=believes>Believes</h2><ul><li>Working code is only the beginning</li><li>Be prepared to throw away something you’ve done in order to do something
different</li><li>Always look for better ways of doing things</li><li>“Good enough” isn’t good enough</li><li>Code is a liability, not an asset</li><li>Treat code like a garden. You are never &ldquo;done&rdquo;</li><li>Prefer immutability</li><li>Model actions as data</li><li>Abstractions and data schemata are hard to get right. You will most likely
change them in the future, so prepare yourself</li><li>Technical excellence is not everything</li><li>Backups don&rsquo;t mean anything unless you have actually tried to restore data
from them</li></ul></article></main><footer><p>Copyright 2023, Florian Winkelbauer. All rights reserved.</p></footer></body></html>
