An antifragile system benefits from disorder
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Have options (instead of obligations)</li>
<li>Create a situation with low downside and high upside</li>
<li>Create systems with slack</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Nonlinear events</b>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Convex: a smiling graph. More potential upside than downside (positive Black
Swan)</li>
<li>Concave: a frowning graph. More potential downside than upside (negative Black
Swan)</li>
<li>You are robust if doubling exposure doubles harm</li>
<li>You are fragile if doubling exposure more than doubles harm</li>
<li>A single 100 pound stone hurts more than 100 one pound stones</li>
<li>A function is concave if the average function value is lower than the
function of the average value</li>
<li>A function is convex if the average function value is higher than the function
of the average value</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Example</b>
</p>

<p>
Traffic is a function, which depends on the amount of cars. This function is
nonlinear (concave), as the following two situations create different outputs:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>One hour of 8.000 cars, followed by one hour of 12.000 cars</li>
<li>Two hours of 10.000 cars</li>

<p>
<b>Why our systems fail and what we can do about it</b>
</p>

<p>
Complexity and coupling increase the chance of big errors. In these systems,
small problems and minor issues can accumulate into an unforeseen meltdown.
</p>

<p>
In the past, nuclear power plants were one of only a few systems which were both
complex and highly coupled. Over the last years more and more systems entered
this domain.
</p>

<p>
How to deal with these systems:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Introduce slack</li>
<li>Reduce moving parts</li>
<li>Replace indirect feedback with direct feedback
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Example of indirect feedback: An indicator light that shows that a valve was
instructed to close</li>
<li>Example of direct feedback: An indicator light which shows the actual state
(open/closed) of a valve</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Techniques:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Aviation and medical institutions use "near miss reports" to deal with small
issues before they can spiral out of control</li>
<li>Use hindsight bias by performing a premortem. Imagine that the project is
completed and that it was a complete failure. What were the reasons why it
failed?</li>
<li>Subjective Probability Interval Estimates (SPIES): Estimate the probability of
several outcomes</li>
</ul>

<p>
Lessons:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Charm school (Everyone should be able to express concern)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Get attention</li>
<li>Express your concern</li>
<li>State the perceived problem</li>
<li>Propose a solution</li>
<li>Ask for agreement</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Soften power cues
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This makes you more approachable, which can encourage people to speak their
mind</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Leaders speak last
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Encourage discussion about different solutions</li>
<li>Not encouraging a discussion can be compared to discouraging a discussion</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Diverse groups are "better" because group members are more skeptical which in
turn makes it more likely to catch small errors.

<div id="outline-container-cap-theorem" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="cap-theorem"><a href="#cap-theorem">CAP Theorem</a></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-cap-theorem">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Consistency</li>
<li>Availability</li>
<li>Partition tolerance</li>
</ul>

<p>
This theorem states that given a network partition (a split brain situation), a
distributed system can either favor consistency or availability.
</p>

<p>
<b>Example:</b> Imagine that you are part of a fully remote wedding. Let's imagine
that you answer "the big question" with yes and let's imagine that your
phone/internet connection breaks before your significant other can answer the
same question. What do you do? Do you say that you are married/not married (in
which case you would favor availability) or do you say "I don't know" (in which
case you would favor consistency).
</p>

<p>
The PACELC theorem is an extension to the CAP theorem: In case of a network
*P*artition, one has to choose between *A*vailability and *C*onsistency,
*E*lse, when a system does not have a partition, one has to choose between
*L*atency and *C*onsistency.
</p>

<p>
Martin Kleppmann posted an <a href="https://martin.kleppmann.com/2015/05/11/please-stop-calling-databases-cp-or-ap.html">interesting article</a> in which he explains that neither
CAP nor PACELC are a good way to think about distributed systems.

<b>Novice Programmer</b>
</p>

<p>
Need rules (<b>not patterns</b>) to guide their way: Don't ask. Follow this advice
and you will be fine.
</p>

<p>
<b>Advanced Beginner</b>
</p>

<p>
Do not follow the rules! Find out why the rules are the rules. We are starting
to get context - we experience how stuff works.
</p>

<p>
<b>Competent</b>
</p>

<p>
You become goal oriented. This is a time based thing. Most people become
competent if they keep doing something.
</p>

<p>
<b>Proficient</b>
</p>

<p>
This is a deliberate step. Things start to become intuition. Patterns start to
become useful. "How can I make this better?"
</p>

<p>
<b>Expert</b>
</p>

<p>
You are operating of instinct. You don't think about rules, you "just know".
This is critical: You don't know how you come up with your decision.

<p>
ACID is more or less a marketing term, it isn't too precise.
</p>

<p>
<b>Durability</b>
</p>

<p>
Used to mean that your database is written to an archive tape. When tape bands
fell out of fashion, durability was redefined as "fsync to disk". With the rise
of distributed system, durability was redefined once more to mean replication.
</p>

<p>
<b>Consistency</b>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This is not the same C as in the CAP theorem</li>
<li>A database moves from one consistent state to the another through
transactions. A consistent state is defined through integrity checks or
invariants (e.g. the balance of an account cannot be negative)</li>
<li>It is a property of how the application uses the database, it is not a
property of the database itself</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Atomicity</b>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>"All or nothing guarantee"</li>
<li>It's about handling crashes/fault, not about concurrency! You either get all
or no parts of a transaction</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Isolation</b>
</p>

<p>
Serializable isolation means that the effects of concurrent transactions is as
though all transactions were performed in a serial (one after the other)
fashion. Each transaction feels as if it had the whole database for itself.
</p>

<p>
Databases have different default and maximum isolation levels. These levels are:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Read Uncommitted</li>
<li>Read Committed:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Dirty reads/writes are not allowed</li>
<li>Does not prevent Read Skew (see below). This is scary, as "Read Committed"
is the default isolation level for several databases</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Snapshot Isolation:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Read skews are not allowed. If a transaction is reading the database, the
transaction sees the database at a specific point in time. Other
transactions do not interfere.</li>
<li>Does not prevent Write Skew</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Repeatable Read</li>
<li>Serializable
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Can prevent Write Skew</li>
<li>Some implementations use two-phase-locking (not two-phase-commit!), which
use shared locks. This can be problematic, as analytical queries lock the
whole databases.</li>
<li>Other solutions (which don't use shared locks) are H-Store and Serializable
Snapshot Isolation</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Race Conditions</b>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Dirty Read: A transaction can read what another unfinished transaction wrote</li>
<li>Dirty Write: Concurrent writes to several tables can interfere with each other</li>
<li>Read Skew: Imagine a transaction which transfers 100 dollars from one account
to another. A backup process might read both accounts at different times (one
before a transaction, and one afterwards), which means that the backup now
contains inconsistent data</li>
<li>Write Skew:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Pattern: Read something, make decision, write decision to database</li>
<li>Example: An ambulance system requires, that each shift has at least one
doctor on call. If several doctors request to go off call at the same time,
we can end up in a situation in which no doctor is on call. This can happen
because these concurrent transactions see the exact same snapshot of a
database</li>
<li>"By the time the write is committed, the premise of the decision is no
longer true"</li>
</ul></li>

<p>
A timestamp on Windows means something completely different than a timestamp on
Unix!
</p>

<p>
Time synchronization (clock drift correction) is the reason why Windows does not
guarantee, that the system time increases monotonically. So you shouldn't use
it. Instead, use something different like the current tick count, or use your
own sequence number.
</p>

<p>
UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) is an effort to create a system on which we can
all agree.
</p>

<p>
Coding advice:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Store timestamps as UTC together with a time zone</li>
<li>Do not store start/end timestamps. Instead, store a start timestamp together
with a duration. This makes it much easier to deal with events such as
day-light saving</li>
<li>Don't always mock out your database layer. The conversation of dates (which
can depend on the time zone of your database <b>and</b> on the time zone of your
operating system) will hunt you down</li>
<li>Make date ranges <b>inclusive</b> from and <b>exclusive</b> to (start &lt;= value &lt;
end)</li>

<p>
Control theory:
</p>

<p>
Present -&gt; Observe -&gt; Feedback -&gt; React -&gt; (Present)
</p>

<p>
A furnace is a classical example of applied control theory: you want to keep
water at a specific temperature. So what do you do? You measure the error (e.g.
the water has 20°C, it should be 100°C, so the error is 80°C) and react with
correcting actions based on the error. To do this, we distinguish three types of
controllers:
</p>

<p>
<b>P Controller</b>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Takes proportional steps to correct an error (e.g. the applied heat is
proportional to the measured error)</li>
<li>These systems tend to oscillate around the desired state</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>PI Controller</b>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Adds an integral to observe an error over time</li>
<li>Such a system still oscillates, but the overall error curve is flattened</li>
<li>Thermostats or cruise controls use PI systems</li>
<li>These systems cannot deal with shocks</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>PID Controller</b>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Adds a derivative component to predict future errors</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Anti Patterns</b>
</p>

<p>
Using open loops is scary. The system cannot detect a problem. Chaos engineering
and observability are fine practices to find open loops. Open loop systems tend
to be imperative (do this, do that), while closed loop system tend to be
declarative (please get the system into my defined desired state).
</p>

<p>
Power laws are out to get you. A system failure can spread in an exponential
way. These failures can be kept in their cages by building smaller systems
(which decrease the overall "blasting radius"). Other techniques include:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Exponential back-off</li>
<li>Rate-limiters</li>
</ul>

<p>
Sudden load spikes can bring down a system. In general: keep your queues short.
LIFO queues might be a good idea, as they will prioritize new information.
</p>

<p>
Implementing edge triggered systems imply, that you have solved the "deliver
just once" problem. Level triggered (and idempotent) systems seem to be a
simpler solution.

We do not have a good intuition for how fast different parts of a computer are.
</p>

<p>
Let's have a look at a 3ghz CPU and different access times:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Register: 0.3ns</li>
<li>L1 cache: 1.5ns</li>
<li>L2 cache: 3ns</li>
<li>L3 cache 13ns</li>
<li>RAM: 0.1 microseconds</li>
<li>HDD: 6ms</li>
<li>SSD: 80 microseconds</li>
</ul>

<p>
All these values seem "low enough", but let's but them into perspective using a
1 Hertz CPU:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Register: 1 second</li>
<li>L1 cache: 4.5 seconds</li>
<li>L2 cache: 9 seconds</li>
<li>L3 cache: 39 seconds</li>

<b>System 1</b>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Unconscious (runs 24/7)</li>
<li>Fast, intuitive</li>
<li>Can multi-task</li>
<li>~11 million bits/second</li>
<li>95% of cognitive function</li>
<li>inaccessible</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>System 2</b>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Conscious</li>
<li>Slow, rational, forgetful</li>
<li>Linear (Cannot multi-task)</li>
<li>~40 bits/second</li>
<li>5% of cognitive function</li>
</ul>

<p>
We identify with System 2 and we believe, that System 2 is in charge.
</p>

<p>
System 1 gains its speed by using heuristics. It is also in charge of "telling
our story" in which we are identified as the hero. System 1 is prone to biases
such as:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Confirmation bias:</b> We seek confirmation instead of information. We like to
stick to our point of view, even in the face of evidence which supports a
different point</li>
<li><b>Cognitive dissonance:</b> We have a hard time to keep two contradicting ideas
in our head</li>
<li><b>Naive realism:</b> We believe that we are rational and that a disagreeing part
will "see" if we present them "our facts"</li>
</ul>

<p>
We overestimate our own understanding and underestimate the role of randomness
in our world. We seek for patterns and explanations, even if there aren't any.
</p>

<p>
System 2 can only focus for about 50 minutes (max) before taking a break.
</p>

<p>
We use System 2 to learn something new. Over time, a certain skill moves to
System 1 (e.g. walking, driving, or playing an instrument). After is has moved
to System 1, interference from System 2 can hurt our performance by
"overthinking".
</p>

<p>
System 2 takes a lot of energy. Self control causes a drop in your blood
glucose. We have a limited pool of "mental energy". This is why we tend to make
worse decisions when tired or hungry.
</p>

<p>
System 2 believes that it runs the show, but System 1 is in charge! And that's
good. You don't want to trust a system which lets you forget your keys to care
about essential tasks such as breathing.

<li>Hard deletes are painful as they can lead to cascading deletes (e.g. deleting
a product may delete user purchases)</li>
<li>We use soft deletes as a "quick fix" to the cascading delete problem</li>
<li>But deleting makes a lot of sense in a "private domain", e.g. when a user
updates the product catalog. We can treat this domain as a sandbox, where the
user can manipulate data in an easy way</li>
<li>We need to validate data when we are publishing it from the "private domain"
to a "public domain" (e.g. so that the customer can see the updated product
catalog)</li>
<li>Deletes in a "public domain" hide business intent. Why do you want to delete
data? Do you really want to delete this product, or do intent to no longer
sell this product?</li>
<li>Systems like Amazon are a collaborative domain. Checking invariants is doomed
to be full of race conditions. Example: A user adds a product to his shopping
cart. An employee marks the same product as "not for sale". Depending on the
timing of these requests, an invariance such as "a user cannot buy an item if
it is not for sale" cannot hold.</li>

<li>The book "Team Topologies" outlines the four fundamental teams you need to
build software fast:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Stream-aligned teams</li>
<li>Enabling teams</li>
<li>Complicated subsystem teams</li>
<li>Platform teams</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Mice, humans and elephants have roughly the same amount of heartbeats in their
lifetime. They also have the same blood pressure. The bigger a mammal, the
slower they live</li>
<li>Complex adaptive systems (mammals, cities or companies) show sub-linear
scaling: doubling one factor (e.g. size) does not double other factors (e.g.
calorie intake, cost of building streets, revenue)</li>
<li>Hierarchical fractal networks scale following a power law with an exponent of
less than one</li>
<li>Queues create back-pressure. Putting a queue into an information flow pauses
the flow</li>
<li>Larger organizations spend less of their revenue on R&amp;D</li>
<li>Cities show more than one type of scaling:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Super-linear: innovation, wages, number of professionals, crime, disease,
pollution (social network)</li>
<li>Sub-linear: road length, number of petrol stations and restaurants, water
pipes, electricity cables (hierarchical network)</li>

<li>How can we apply complexity theory to software development?</li>
<li>Creating software can be boiled down to a two step algorithm:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a random simulation of our environments, followed by</li>
<li>an NKP analysis
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>N: the amount of components</li>
<li>K: the amount of connections between components. More connections leads to
more chaos</li>
<li>P: a bias between connections. A higher bias reduces chaos</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Stressors can be categorized using attractors. We often design a system for a
single attractor, which is a mistake</li>
<li>A good start: "What if a giant laser lizard burns down our city? What's your
residue?"</li>
<li>A matrix which maps components and stressors can help you to identify
non-function requirements. It shows you hidden coupling and weak spots</li>

<li>Humans are terrible at decision making. Flipping a coin is often an easier
solution than "analyzing data" or "trusting your gut". We have known this
since 1954, but we don't want to believe it's true</li>
<li>Simple models can achieve better decisions than we can</li>
<li>Human decision making is noisy</li>
<li>Bias: predictable error that always has the same effect on thinking and
decision-making</li>
<li>Noise: variable error that can move thinking and decision-making in any
direction</li>
<li>We never really track our decision or estimation making accuracy. But we
should!</li>
<li>Create a simple algorithm but don't go overboard. Allow some "human wiggle
room"</li>
<li>Premortems are a reliable way to reduce bias and noise</li>
<li>Structured interviews are a great hiring tool. Google does it too!</li>
<li>If you do new things, you'll never accurately estimate time and effort to

<li>Traditional layered architecture has the database at the bottom</li>
<li>If you map out a request that travels through your layers the database is in
the middle (since you go down the layers and up again)</li>
<li>Instead we want to have our domain logic in the middle and our I/O at the edges</li>
<li>"Good design": pure functions (deterministic functions that have input and
output without side effects)</li>
<li>"Bad design": anything that uses I/O</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTkzNHF6rMs">Garry Burnhardt</a> coined the term "Functional Core, Imperative Shell"</li>

<li>Ironies of automation
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Humans design the automation and then also deal with its unanticipated, often negatie consequences</li>
<li>Human operators have to monitor that the automation is working properly</li>
<li>The amount of knowledge required to make things right again is likely to be
greater than that required during normal operations</li>
<li>Automation designers' intention is to train humans in following instructions
("Use the run book!") and put them in a system that requires them to provide
intelligence outside or beyond those instructions</li>
</ul></li>
<li>75% of the time, humans have to intervene to resolve automation-involved incidents</li>
<li>Automation plays multiple roles in (the same) incident</li>
<li>Automation can unexpectedly make things worse</li>
<li>Human intervention remains essential to resolve issues</li>
<li>Better automation through joint cognitive systems</li>
<li>Use automation to augment what we do. Transform automation from a "bad
colleague" to a collaborative team player</li>
