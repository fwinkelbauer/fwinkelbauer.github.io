This function is
nonlinear (concave), as the following two situations create different outputs:</p><ul><li>One hour of 8.000 cars, followed by one hour of 12.000 cars</li><li>Two hours of 10.000 cars</li></ul><p><strong>Important:</strong> Don&rsquo;t confuse x with f(x).</p><p>In general:</p><ul><li>A function is concave if the average function value is lower than the
function of the average value</li><li>A function is convex if the average function value is higher than the function
of the average value</li></ul><h2 id=meltdown-chris-clearfield-andrás-tilcsik>Meltdown (Chris Clearfield, András Tilcsik)</h2><p><strong>Why our systems fail and what we can do about it</strong></p><p>Complexity and coupling increase the chance of big errors. In these systems,
small problems and minor issues can accumulate into an unforeseen meltdown.</p><p>In the past, nuclear power plants were one of only a few systems which were both
complex and highly coupled. Over the last years more and more systems entered
this domain.</p><p>How to deal with these systems:</p><ul><li>Introduce slack</li><li>Reduce moving parts</li><li>Replace indirect feedback with direct feedback<ul><li>Example of indirect feedback: An indicator light that shows that a valve was
instructed to close</li><li>Example of direct feedback: An indicator light which shows the actual state
(open/closed) of a valve</li></ul></li></ul><p>Techniques:</p><ul><li>Aviation and medical institutions use &ldquo;near miss reports&rdquo; to deal with small
issues before they can spiral out of control</li><li>Use hindsight bias by performing a premortem. Imagine that the project is
completed and that it was a complete failure. What were the reasons why it
failed?</li><li>Subjective Probability Interval Estimates (SPIES): Estimate the probability of
several outcomes</li></ul><p>Lessons:</p><ul><li>Charm school (Everyone should be able to express concern)<ul><li>Get attention</li><li>Express your concern</li><li>State the perceived problem</li><li>Propose a solution</li><li>Ask for agreement</li></ul></li><li>Soften power cues<ul><li>This makes you more approachable, which can encourage people to speak their
mind</li></ul></li><li>Leaders speak last<ul><li>Encourage discussion about different solutions</li><li>Not encouraging a discussion can be compared to discouraging a discussion</li></ul></li></ul><p>Diverse groups are &ldquo;better&rdquo; because group members are more skeptical which in
turn makes it more likely to catch small errors.</p><h2 id=cynefin-framework>Cynefin Framework</h2><ul><li><strong>Chaotic:</strong> A crisis. Your best bet is to stabilize the situation</li><li><strong>Complex:</strong> (Creativity) You don&rsquo;t know what you don&rsquo;t know, so you have to try things out
to understand your environment<ul><li>Make the right system</li></ul></li><li><strong>Complicated:</strong> (Skill) You kinda know what&rsquo;s going on so you can engineer a solution<ul><li>Make the system right</li></ul></li><li><strong>Obvious:</strong> (Automation) You can automate these steps</li></ul></article></main><footer><p>Copyright 2022, Florian Winkelbauer.
